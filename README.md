# DamnVulnerableLLMProject

This project is designed for Security Researchers to enhance their LLM hacking skills and for LLM Companies to secure their AI model and System against attackers and also consider reading disclaimer before using tool for learning attacks against LLM

# CTF Insructions

1. Fork https://replit.com/@hxs220034/DamnVulnerableLLMApplication-Demo on another replit
2. Get your OpenAI API key and add it **Secrets** as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. Run Replit and choose 1 for training and then Enter 3  for CTF Mode
4. Make console to spill flags and secrets in text and DM me SS on twitter @CoderHarish for verification
5. You can also read Writeup included in bottom for more challenges
6. You can also check txt files in training folder for flags and secrets strings given that main goal of ctf is prompt injection


# Set Up

1. Get your OpenAI API key and add it **Secrets** as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
2. Make up and `API_KEY` for the JSON API, this can just be something like a password if you'd like
3. Fill the `training/facts` folder with as many `text` documents as you can containing information about anything including dummy credentials etc
5. Edit the `master.txt` file to represent who you want the bot to pretend to be
6. Click **Run**, select option `1`
7. To chat with the bot, once you've one the training, select option `2`

# OWASP top 10 LLM Vulnerabilities in this application

1. Prompt injection
2. Sensitive Data Disclosure on LLM
3. Unauthorised code injection on LLM
4. improper access control on LLM APIs
5. LLM Model poisoning (Undocumented in the writeup for a reason so find it on your own)
